## 🕊️ **Radha-Krishna: Beyond Time and Space**  
In the lush forests of **Braj**, Radha and Krishna’s divine love unfolded, a union of soul and the infinite. **Radha**, the eternal devotee, embodies love in its purest form, while **Krishna**, the cosmic flute player, is the soul’s ultimate destination.  

This project draws inspiration from the **bhakti tradition**, particularly the practice of **roopdhyan**—meditative visualization of the divine. By presenting them in modern, relatable scenarios, this project becomes a humble offering for **those seeking a personal connection with the divine**, even amidst the chaos of the digital world.
